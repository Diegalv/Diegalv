- 👋 Hi, I’m Diego Alves Ferreira
- 👀 I’m interested in technologies that are changing the way we live, solving problems in a simple and agile way. I am also interested in investments and the global economy
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about generative AI, the Internet of Things and digital marketing
- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that need to solve problems, where I can contribute with my enthusiasm and energy, in addition to my communication skills, partnership building, negotiation and critical and aggregating analysis in business.
- - 📫 Contact me however you prefer. I am available mainly by phone and WhatsApp. But you can also contact me through social media or email diegoafadm@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns? Call me "Diego", anyway
- ⚡ Fun fact: During a career transition, I worked as an Uber driver in São Paulo. The idea was to keep my finances in order and to network. I am passionate about people and entrepreneurship. And these passions led me to become a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant. That's right! I sold makeup from my car, and it sold very well! The surprise effect was my main weapon, and the presentation of the products, followed by a strong closing, was the perfect way to end the deal
